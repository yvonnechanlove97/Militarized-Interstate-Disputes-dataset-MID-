Private Project for STAT430 DSPM (Spring 2019) by yongc2, dkoruna2 and zcleary2

## Project goal:  
In this project, we will apply data cleaning, data mining and data visualiazation techniques to discover the version4 of the Militarized Interstate Disputes dataset
(MID).

## Data Introduction:  
Version 4 of the MID data collection compiled by the Correlates of War Project provides information about conflicts in which one or more states threaten, display, or use force against one or more other states between 1816 and 2010.
Militarized interstate disputes are united historical cases of conflict in which the threat, display or use of military 
force short of war by one member state is explicitly directed towards the government, official representatives, official forces, property, or territory of another state. Disputes are composed of incidents 
that range in intensity from threats to use force to actual combat short of war. There are two MID dataset based on different perspective unit.
MIDA dataset contains one record per militarized participant at the dispute level. Meanwhile MIDB dataset contains one record per millitarized dispute participant at the participant level.
